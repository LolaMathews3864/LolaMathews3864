## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a cloud engineer focused on automating the provisioning and management of scalable, secure cloud environments using Terraform and AWS. This project highlights best practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cross-provider orchestration, and seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines for modern DevOps workflows.

At the core of this repository is Terraform, an open-source IaC tool that enables declarative cloud infrastructure management. I use Terraform to define and deploy a wide range of AWS resourcesâ€”such as VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM roles, Lambda functions, and RDS databasesâ€”using reusable modules and state management strategies that promote consistency, traceability, and automation across environments.

This project is designed with multi-cloud compatibility in mind. While AWS is the primary provider, the structure and syntax support extensibility to other platforms like Azure and Google Cloud. By abstracting provider-specific configurations and adopting modular design, the infrastructure remains adaptable to hybrid or multi-cloud strategies as business needs evolve.

To support agile operations, Iâ€™ve integrated CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automate validation, plan generation, and apply stages. Infrastructure changes are tracked through version control, peer-reviewed via pull requests, and automatically tested before deployment. This approach ensures safer rollouts, faster iteration, and better collaboration across teams.

Whether you're provisioning cloud-native applications, managing multi-region infrastructure, or enforcing repeatable DevOps practices, this repository provides a production-ready template for using Terraform and AWS to automate cloud infrastructure at scale.
